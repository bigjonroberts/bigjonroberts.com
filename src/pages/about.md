I have four (mostly) grown children. My wife Callie and I will be celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary in 2023.
I love good green tea, especially Dragon Well.
I'm currently DM'ing some [Dungeon World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_World) adventures for my neices and nephews.
I'm also fixing up a [Wimbleton White 1969 Ford Ranchero Rio Grande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Ranchero#Fourth_generation_(1968%E2%80%931969))
I coach and still play some basketball.
This is a lot of "I" on this page and it makes me uncomfortable.
